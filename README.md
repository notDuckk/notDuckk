# Hello, I'm Daylen! üëã

I'm a passionate developer focused on creating practical, real-world solutions. I enjoy working with a variety of technologies to build efficient, full-stack applications. I‚Äôm continuously learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks to sharpen my skills and stay current with industry trends. My goal is to write clean, maintainable code and develop systems that are both functional and scalable.


## üîß Projects

### [WeatherWiz](https://github.com/notDuckk/weatherApp)
A simple weather app that uses the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display weather data based on your location or any city you search. Built using **JavaScript**.

### [Currency Converter](https://github.com/notDuckk/currencyCoverter)
A currency converter app that lets users convert currencies and stores their conversion history. It communicates with the [Free Currency API](https://freecurrencyapi.com/). Built using **Express** and **Sequelize** to handle conversions and data storage.

### [Twitter Clone](https://github.com/Wassword/sharespace)
A Twitter clone currently in progress as part of a group project. This is a beginner-level project that is still under development, but it demonstrates the core functionality of a social media app. The project is a collaborative effort involving four developers.
